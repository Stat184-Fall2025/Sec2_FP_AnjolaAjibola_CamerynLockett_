# EV growth in the US

This repository analyzes how electric vehicle (EV) adoption has grown across the United States from 2017–2025 and compares EV fueling costs to gasoline costs across states. Using public datasets, the project highlights national trends, state-level differences, and cost advantages of EVs.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to study the growth of electric vehicles in the U.S. over time and understand where adoption is increasing the most. Using monthly vehicle registration data, we measure changes in EV share nationally and by state, identify states with the highest and fastest-growing EV adoption, and compare fueling costs (gas vs. EV charging) to better understand affordability as a factor in adoption decisions

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements
This project uses two primary data sources:

Electric Vehicle Population Size History by County: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-size-history-by-county
Source: Data.gov
Collected by: Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)
Purpose: Tracks monthly vehicle registrations (EV and non-EV) by county and state, allowing analysis of EV share and growth over time 

EV Charging Equivalent vs. Gasoline Price by State (Q4 2024): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7Dl45Ma6HEeafiPcw_F1yRD3S2L32bOHGSyJ3mdZ1M/edit?gid=0#gid=0
Source: Stable Auto Corporation
Purpose: Provides state level comparisons of EV charging costs and gasoline costs, including cost-per-mile estimates and EV fuel savings 

## Repo Structure

Here's an overview of key files in this repository:

- **Final Project.qmd**  
  The main Quarto file containing the full analysis for the project. This file includes the research questions, data provenance, FAIR and CARE principles discussion, exploratory data analysis, tables, figures, and narrative explanations. The final PDF report is rendered from this file.

- **Final Project.pdf**  
  The completed project report rendered in PDF format from the Quarto file and submitted for the final project.

- **README.md**  
  This file provides a brief overview of the project, including its purpose, key insights, data sources, authors, and guidance for navigating the repository.

- **Data/**  
  Contains all datasets used in this project, including the raw EV adoption data and EV vs. gasoline fueling cost data. These files serve as the foundation for all analyses and visualizations in the project.
