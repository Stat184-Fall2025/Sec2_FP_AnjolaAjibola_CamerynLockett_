,"Stable Auto’s EV Charging Cost vs. Gasoline Price Index is estimated by using the average cost of public charging across DCFC and L2 stations tracked by Stable, as well as the average retail cost of electricity estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration from  2023 (retrieved 1/28/25).

The gasoline price equivalent is a blended cost assuming 63% of charging happens at home, 21% of charging happens at Public L2 stations, and 16% of charging happens at public DCFCs, based on research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).

The gasoline price equivalent is equal to the average blended charging energy cost by state multiplied by 33.7 (EPA definition of MPGe) divided by 4. This assumes the average EV has an MPGe of 100 and the average internal combustion vehicle has a fuel economy of 25 MPG.

The EV gasoline discount and average gasoline prices by state use the average price of regular gasoline retrieved from from AAA (retrieved 1/28/25).

Methodology note: These numbers reflect the most recent data collected by Stable Auto on Public DCFC prices across the thousands of chargers we track. It does not include all stations or all chargers and may not reflect current pricing at those stations.
